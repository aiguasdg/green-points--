## **GREEN POINTS #**

Welcome to Green Point Sustained!

Have you ever thought about how much you contaminate every day?
Why don't you try to know how much you contaminate in your daily life?

Green Points # is the answer. An application that let you know how much you pollute.

The app is easy to use. You only have to put the kind of transport you use, the food you eat, the energy you consume and the materials you recycle. In order to insert the food, you only have to take photos of the meals (the app will automatically detect each ingredient). 

It's been programated with java and XML, and it's compatible with Android.
